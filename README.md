# Minesweeper

    The game we know and love from Windows 95 days -- this was fun to make and I'll probably come back to it to improve on it.

## Tech

- Create-React-App for initial scaffolding
- Emotion for CSS-in-JS styling
- Chakra-UI for base component library
- TypeScript for developer experience
- XState to try out infinite state machines

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the usual Create-React-App commands:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
